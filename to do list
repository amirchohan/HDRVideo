Project TODO list:
	Create a Stitching class containing different methods of stitching
	Similarly create a ToneMap class


Breakdown:
	HDR from multiple images
		Use existing algorithms to stitch together multiple LDR images into a single HDR image

	Tone Mapping Algorithms
		Once a HDR image is acheived, tone-map it

	HDR from single image
		Take a well-exposure LDR image and increase the contrast in it hence converting it to HDR


	Make this work on a mobile phone

	Create a pipeline for real-time HDR videos
